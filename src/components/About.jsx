              Hi, I'm Aristo — a curious and committed Computer Science student
              with a passion for Software Development, Data Science, and the
              ever-evolving world of AI and Machine Learning. I enjoy solving
              problems with code almost as much as I enjoy pretending to be calm
              when my code doesn't work. Whether I'm building user-friendly web
              apps or analyzing data to uncover hidden insights, I'm driven by the
              challenge of turning ideas into impactful digital solutions.

              Outside the tech world, I'm your go-to guy for spontaneous conversations 
              about cars, gaming, or why pineapple on pizza is still a global controversy. 
              I'm fluent in English and Kiswahili, speak intermediate Japanese, and I'm eagerly diving into German. 
              I believe learning never stops — unless a server crashes, then we all take a break. 
              I'm always exploring new technologies, languages (both spoken and coded), 
              and looking for ways to grow and collaborate on meaningful projects.
